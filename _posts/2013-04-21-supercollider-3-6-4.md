## SuperCollider 3.6.4 is released!

The release brings a bunch of small enhancements and important bugfixes to the
new IDE, steadily advancing its quality. Thanks to involvement of testers on
Mac OS X, some issues with key bindings specific to the platform have been
fixed. Moreover, the IDE on Mac OS X now uses a common global menu bar for all
its windows (including detached docklets).

There is also several bugfixes to the standard SC class library and core server
functionality, and improvements of documentation.

Enjoy SuperCollider 3.6.4!
