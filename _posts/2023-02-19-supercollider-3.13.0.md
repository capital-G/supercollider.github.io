We are pleased to announce the release of SuperCollider 3.13.0! The release is available here: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases/tag/Version-3.13.0

Here's a list of notable changes since SuperCollider 3.12.2:
- Numerous UGens have been fixes so that they calculate their initial value as originally intended. Please note that in some cases this may create a different result than previously
- A universal Intel x86_64 and Apple arm64 macOS build is now provided

CHANGELOG.md contains a more extensive list of changes.

A big thank you to all developers for your contributions!
