We are pleased to announce the release of SuperCollider 3.13.1! The release is available here: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases/tag/Version-3.13.1

This release fixes HID support on Linux.

There are no functional updates for macOS and Windows and we won't be publishing new binaries for these platforms. Please use [3.13.0](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases/tag/Version-3.13.0) to download builds for these platforms.

A big thank you to all developers for your contributions!
